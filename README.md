#BattleShips

The game is ready to play when theres are two players initialized with a board each and each board has 5 ships placed. 

By default it is player1's go first and after each shot it will switch the turns until there is a winner. 

A game_setup.rb file has been added which sets up the game to a ready state placeing each ship from colums A through to E vertically.
